Current Info

5'10 / Size 9 Boot / 200lbs

So it's my second year snowboarding and I recently got the Arbor Westmark Camber Frank April 156. It's a great board and it has been fun to ride in the park and on the resort. I'm looking for a second board in the all mountain category that can cover the riding from resort up to bigger mountain stuff and potentially some powder (I board East Coast, NY PA and VT so deep powder isn't really a concern). My first board to start was an Arbor Coda Rocker 154 which I now realize is way too small and not suited for the conditions I ride in.  I would say I'm pushing into intermediate and I like going fast and really learning and progress in carving while I'm not learning park. So what do people thing as a secondary board to the quiver? Also if people have thoughts on sizing that would be great, I'm 200 now which is my heaviest but if I can lose weight (fingers crossed) I would sit around 170-180. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Looking for a secondary board to add to my park board for general east coast riding for all mountain and maybe some deeper snow.",Looking for a second complimentary snowboard to round out my riding.,"hey all,

0,kv6rpj,DubelBoom,"Hi!
So I want to get new boots. My board and bindings are GNU T2B and Burton Mission, both 2020 models.
It's time for me to replace my old and very bad boots.

I like the Burton Ruler, but where I am they only have last year's model. Is there any major difference between last and this year's model? I have no problem getting the older ones, if the seller would lower the price to reflect it being older.

Any other models recommended maybe for that price range? I am snowboarding a week for 10 years now, doing mostly piste going high speed and off piste. Almost no park (yes, I know my board is not the best for that) 
I was also looking at some nitro model, can't remember which one, but it was less comfortable for me. 

I'm currently at a ski vacation and prices are better than my home country, so I want to buy it now.

0,kmverh,Obi-Wan-Kenoby," 

I bought my current snowboard back in High School, twenty years ago, and the edge has separated from the board on my heel side edge. When I bought it I just bought the cheapest board I could find and didn't really know what type of terrain I preferred.

Well, now I'm a grown man (well my wife may debate that fact) and I want to purchase the right board for me. I prefer to snowboard off the groomed runs if I can, but often times the groomed runs are the only option. I love to ride in powder when I can find it, and my favorite thing to do is go through the trees and find my own path. With this in mind I feel like a need a board that is more versatile. Something that can switch from toe to heel edge quickly and is more easily maneuverable through the trees. However, I don't really ride in the park very much, and I'm too old for tricks and all that. Also, I still need my board to be able to handle the normal groomed runs when there isn't enough snow to ride through the trees. What type of board should I be looking at? Any recommendations on a specific board?

Thanks in advance!

well, now i'm a grown man (well my wife may debate that fact) and i want to purchase the right board for me. i prefer to snowboard off the groomed runs if i can, but often times the groomed runs are the only option. i love to ride in powder when i can find it, and my favorite thing to do is go through the trees and find my own path. with this in mind i feel like a need a board that is more versatile. something that can switch from toe to heel edge quickly and is more easily maneuverable through the trees. however, i don't really ride in the park very much, and i'm too old for tricks and all that. also, i still need my board to be able to handle the normal groomed runs when there isn't enough snow to ride through the trees. what type of board should i be looking at? any recommendations on a specific board?

thanks in advance!

This is the start of my second season snowboarding (East Coast). I have been skiing since I was young and made the change last year. I picked up an Arbor Coda Rocker 153 and some Hemlock Bindings and over the past season I'm pretty in control on Blues and some Blacks, just working on carving and being efficient with movement. I haven't ridden too much camber (other than some rentals) but the Arbor Coda Rocker does seem to not hold an edge as well... but that could be my in-experience as well, I'm not sure. Have people used both of these boards to recommend that the Westmark might be a better board for me in terms of learning to carve? I'll likely be spending my time in the resort and trying to learn the park. Thanks! Any input is appreciated or even different board recommendations.

0,jasqqv,EZtheOG,"I am looking for a new snowboard jacket and pants. I'm rocking older gear; a 2010 AK 3L jacket and prob 2012 Ride Pants. LOL Ride doesn't even make soft gear anymore.

I really love my pants but they're showing their age. The snowboard pants weatherproofing is dead. The AK Jacket is not bad but I kind of hate riding with it or, at the very least, I don't know how to properly layer so that I don't have the problems I have. If it's \~30F I am sweating with just a longsleeve t-shirt when riding and then I'm freezing on the way up. Then, when it's super cold, doesn't matter how many layers it's kind of shit.

Thanks!",Recommendations for Jacket and Pants,"i am looking for a new snowboard jacket and pants. i'm rocking older gear; a 2010 ak 3l jacket and prob 2012 ride pants. lol ride doesn't even make soft gear anymore.

i really love my pants but they're showing their age. the snowboard pants weatherproofing is dead. the ak jacket is not bad but i kind of hate riding with it or, at the very least, i don't know how to properly layer so that i don't have the problems i have. if it's \~30f i am sweating with just a longsleeve t-shirt when riding and then i'm freezing on the way up. then, when it's super cold, doesn't matter how many layers it's kind of shit.

I've started building a small quiver of in-bounds boards and have learned enough about different snowboards that I realized I have no idea what I'm looking for in a splitboard.  Id really appreciate any advice as I haven't been able to demo a splitboard and they're pretty expensive.

Me: 5'11"" ~175lbs. 

Riding: Tahoe area, primarily Squaw/Aline and Kirkwood. Conditions permitting I want be in steep/deep finding (small) natural features to jump off and love mellow tree runs too. I don't get much enjoyment from groomers or park.  I rarely ride switch but I like having the ability to when needed.  As far as style points go, I'll ambitiously try to throw a 360 or tamedog in VERY soft snow, but for the most part happy with simple grabs and being off the ground.

Go-to board 90% of the time: Burton Custom X (161cm).  I love this board as its so stable.  I trust it to do what I want, but sometimes want something a bit more playful for messing around.  

Playful board: Libtech Attack Banana (159cm).  This was my first board, and after inheriting the Custom X I now find it fairly hard to ride.  If it get into a carve it'll hold decently, but generally it feels a little too squirrelly.  While the softer flex (compared to the Custom X) can be fun for messing around I don't feel like to handles bumps all that well.  I'm not sure how much my complaint stems from the flex or the hybrid camber profile.

Park/Spring Board: Rossignol Retox (153cm).  I acquired this board under the impression that I'd venture into a park, but that almost never actually happens.  I don't ride this board all too often but I find its fun and comfortably stable in spring conditions.

I think I want a ""do it all, moderately aggressive all-mountain"" style split (still nailing down terminology between what is all mountain vs freeride).  I've seen posts calling boards like the Jones Solution only geared toward aggressive big mountain (I imagine to be somewhat like the Custom X?) which might be too application specific for an all purpose board?  

I'd love any advice on everything from boards to look at (Weston backwoods, Jones explorer/mountain twin, Signal tailgunner, venture storm?) to general advice on characteristics of boards to help me relate what I feel to an actually spec (hybrid vs camber, flex, etc).  Thanks!!",First splitboard buying advice,"hey all,

0,fgyrqq,CleverComments,"About me: I'm 6'0"", fluctuate between 190 and 210 pounds depending on the season (210 at start, 190 at the end). I get about 15-20 days / year on snow. I've been riding for about \~10 years. I have a size 11 boot. 

What I've ridden before: I started on some Burton beginner board, but graduated to the Ride Machete (fun board, but a little unstable at high speed for me). Then got the Ride Highlife UL, and fell in love. Won a Jones Hovercraft from Jeremy, and thoroughly enjoy that board as well. 

Terrain I ride: I never hit the park. The closest I come to any ""tricks"" would be popping off berms on piste. Mostly I spend my time in trees, on steeps, or wherever the powder is. I do a lot of in-resort hiking to get to the good stuff, but don't have the gear/training for back country yet. 

The question:

I blew out the edge of my Ride Highlife UL 2 seasons ago. Since then, I've been making do with my Hovercraft. Last season, I got pretty lucky and everywhere I ended up going had at least a few inches of fresh (and some places got dumped on). This year, so far, my luck hasn't been as ridiculous. While I love carving on the hovercraft on good groomed runs, at speed and through chop, I haven't been as thrilled. I also feel less secure on some of the super sketch runs I like to do (Tower 3 Chute at Jackson Hole, A-Z chutes at Big Sky, etc). 

What I'm looking for is basically the Highlife UL 2.0. I want something that's going to be usable regardless of conditions, with less emphasis on powder performance, since I already have the hovercraft. In particular, I want something with great edge hold, good stability at speed, and good maneuverability in trees / steeps. 

I've ""narrowed"" it down to a few: 

\-Jones Mountain Twin Ultra  
\-Jones Frontier  
\-Ride Warpig

However on snow, the board slides too much that I cannot go forward. Each step slides downhill, i cannot walk uphill as shown in those penguin walk youtube videos. It seems to me you really have to stab the toe edge deep into the snow for the board to not slide, and my board is a stiff cruise boad.

So the questionfor those who can penguin walk is: do you need a soft board with protruding edge to penguin walk?

0,ep3ctb,de_bedframe,"Hello! I’m getting in to snowboarding as a second passion of mine and I’m progressively getting better but I think it is time for a new board.

I’m slowly leaving the beginner stages of snowboarding and am looking into the more intermediate/advanced aspects snowboarding has to offer.

0,ej7fkm,Sladeix,"I’ve narrowed down my decision to two boards either the Capita DOA or the Capita Ultrafear. I’ve heard amazing things about both boards but can’t decide. 


The DOA is just so amazing at everything however do to its stiffer flex and zero camber it makes the board less playful which kinda sucks yet from this it allows the board to be a great all mountain board too which is nice because my family doesn’t go into the park often and i would like to ride with them, finally the board is built for bigger jumps yet i don’t see myself going off the big jumps very often i lean more towards medium to small plus some jibs but that might change.


Then there is the Ultrafear which is a very playful board and even though the Capita gives it the same flex as the DOA almost everyone says it’s super soft furthermore its been rated as one of the best park boards this season. It’s great for jibbing and getting playful and not sure about this but i think it’s also pretty good at jumps but not so much on the big jumps. Then there is the issue of it not being all mountain which limits the time i get to spend skiing with my family and friends however i could keep my current board which is a all mountain/park board but the hassle would be switching the boards out during the day.

I ride mainly on the east coast so there is not much powder, especially towards the end of the season when I do a lot of riding. I am fairly experienced and split my time fairly between the park (mainly hitting boxes, rails, jumps) and also  carving and bombing blacks. My friend group is fairly split on what they enjoy so I'm pretty much all over the mountain all day but mainly enjoy the parks.   

&amp;#x200B;

Im currently looking at Bataleon Boards, specifically the Whatever and the Disaster. (Don't really like the design on the evil twin) I currently ride a medium flex Burton board (Camber) and enjoy it a lot but I feel like it is slightly more stiff than I desire.I struggle to hold butters extremely well and am hoping to find something a little more playful which is why I slightly desire a softer flex. However, I am worried a softer board such as the Disaster and others will result in significant decrease in my stability on jumps as well as riding at high speeds and holding my edge while carving blacks. Then again with how light I am I wonder if a wider but softer board will provide the best of both worlds. What are your board suggestions and advice. While I am interested in bataleon I have researched and am not opposed to other brands as well  Niche, Burton, GNU, LibTech, Salomon, etc... anything that'll fit my style",Need advice on a new board for next season.

i ride mainly on the east coast so there is not much powder, especially towards the end of the season when i do a lot of riding. i am fairly experienced and split my time fairly between the park (mainly hitting boxes, rails, jumps) and also  carving and bombing blacks. my friend group is fairly split on what they enjoy so i'm pretty much all over the mountain all day but mainly enjoy the parks.   

&amp;#x200b;

im currently looking at bataleon boards, specifically the whatever and the disaster. (don't really like the design on the evil twin) i currently ride a medium flex burton board (camber) and enjoy it a lot but i feel like it is slightly more stiff than i desire.i struggle to hold butters extremely well and am hoping to find something a little more playful which is why i slightly desire a softer flex. however, i am worried a softer board such as the disaster and others will result in significant decrease in my stability on jumps as well as riding at high speeds and holding my edge while carving blacks. then again with how light i am i wonder if a wider but softer board will provide the best of both worlds. what are your board suggestions and advice. while i am interested in bataleon i have researched and am not opposed to other brands as well  niche, burton, gnu, libtech, salomon, etc... anything that'll fit my style need advice on a new board for next season. looking at bataleon.",am ish lb male shoe size ride mainly on the east coast so there is not much powder especially towards the end of the season when do lot of riding am fairly experienced and split my time fairly between the park mainly hitting box rail jump and also carving and bombing black my friend group is fairly split on what they enjoy so pretty much all over the mountain all day but mainly enjoy the park amp x200b im currently looking at bataleon board specifically the whatever and the disaster don really like the design on the evil twin currently ride medium flex burton board camber and enjoy it lot but feel like it is slightly more stiff than desire struggle to hold butter extremely well and am hoping to find something little more playful which is why slightly desire softer flex however am worried softer board such a the disaster and others will result in significant decrease in my stability on jump a well a riding at high speed and holding my edge while carving black then again with how light am wonder if wider but softer board will provide the best of both world what are your board suggestion and advice while am interested in bataleon have researched and am not opposed to other brand a well niche burton gnu libtech salomon etc anything that ll fit my style need advice on new board for next season looking at bataleon

Just bought a ""new"" 2010 Burton dominant on eBay to replace my old Dom that got destroyed when I was in a bad car accident.  The 2010 Dom has a channel system, and from what I have been reading, it's a different channel system than that now deployed on newer Burton boards (the channel is now wider/narrower, I guess?).

I am having a hard time finding definitive answers on which bindings available today will be compatible with that m5 channel on the 2010 Burton Dominant.  Can anyone give me any pointers?  Will any Flow bindings work?  Will m5 conversion kits make all of this moot and allow me to fasten pretty much any binding to my ""new"" board (as long as the disk is compatible)?

1,m3skmu,skyland55,"Hi!  I need an advice!!

I'm a beginner and have been to Big Bear/Snow Summit a few times.  Last time I was there (Snow Summit), I could make it down on easy trails like Cruiser (chair 9) and Summit Run (chair 2), though I struggled with some of the steeper sections on those runs.  The Summit Run was so long for me I had to stop quite a few times along the way. Now we have a plan to go up to Mammoth mountain for the first time and have no idea what it's like up there.  

Which runs at Mammoth are comparable to the ones I mentioned at Snow Summit?  Mammoth offers a cheaper beginner ticket, which allows use of chair 7, 11, 15 &amp; 17 only.  If I was struggling on the easy trails at Snow Summit, do you think I should stick with the beginner tickets, or should I go for the full priced tickets...?  

We are staying for 7 days.  I'd probably ski 3-4 days only.  Might take a private lesson the first day.  

Their trail map has green and black/green, and I'm wondering how black/green trails compare to runs like Cruiser and Summit Run at Snow Summit. 

Also, how easy/difficult is it to move from one base to the other at Mammoth?

1,lxuwrm,genericdude999,"I've seen people do it at the resort and in various YouTube videos, and in [this very short instruction video](https://youtu.be/73JsRlu_j5I) but the guy doesn't really explain anything.   I can't find any other instruction videos and people on the cross country ski subreddits are telling me it's a completely different technique from Nordic skate skiing.

I tried visually copying the guy in the video but my push off ski is slipping sideways across the snow without providing any forward motion.    All I'm getting is some motion from my double poling.   

Any pointers?   It looks so easy but so far I just can't get it.

**EDIT:**  Did it!   Just got back.   I followed /u/pointandgo 's and /u/nordic_nerd
's advice and did the [Marathon drill](https://youtu.be/oJAjexZ0CGE?t=163).   Back and forth, both sides and both directions on a slight incline/decline.   At first it felt horrible, but I made sure to push at about 45 degrees 100% with my edge and no poles (diagonal knife cuts in the snow all along the track), and as I learned to let my ski in the track coast it began to feel like kicking a skateboard but pushing with my ski edge diagonally instead of with my foot.   After about 30 minutes my balance on the track ski improved, and when I got out of the tracks I was able to propel myself along with deep V's in the snow.   As /u/nordic_nerd said I had been working too hard trying to push myself with my edges directly forward like a classic skier instead of just doing V's and letting the skis do the work of propelling me forward.   I think that was the key that unlocked the skill for me. 

To make sure I wasn't using even the half inch of fishscales contacting the snow, I went and got my alpine skis and tried them with no poles.   Right away as /u/crunchyRoadkill said, it was actually easier on the alpine gear than my classic XC skis.   Maybe because the ski is wider underfoot and you have a stiffer boot helping you balance?    I unlocked the cuff on the boot too and that helped me take a longer stride for more glide.   I went back and forth slightly uphill and downhill on a big open area many times.   TWO HOURS total after all my frustrated attempts to figure it out on my own.

1,lqnpep,seleaner015,"I taught skiing every winter for 7 years in high school and college. My last year doing it, on my last day, I got taken out by a snowboarder HARD during a lesson with little kids on a blue trail. I had whiplash, an injured ACL, and a ton bruises. One poor kid I was teaching also got hit, we tumbled down the trail together as I screamed at the out of control moron and took his pass when we stopped sliding. 

I have always been extra cautious since then. While I consider myself advanced/expert, I never ski too fast even though I can control myself. I don’t ski right through crowded areas and I ALWAYS slow down to weave through densely congested areas safely. I check behind me a few times every run to make sure I’m not cutting people off, or to avoid getting hit again by some dummy gunning it down the hill.

All of this was to no avail. Sunday night on my FIRST RUN down an easy warm up trail, I was suddenly overtaken by what felt like a FREIGHT TRAIN. A snowboarder going straight down the hill (who had no business being on a blue and couldn’t stop) hit me from behind, directly in the back. My skis were 40 yards behind me and one my poles was nearly bent in half. Mind you, there were maybe 2 other people on this trail and it’s extremely wide, I ski very methodically so it’s not like I cut him off.

I'm looking for my first pair of ski boots and I've already spent a few days trying to find the proper ones. I consider it 110+ flex index and Cabrio design (preferably without a walk mode, as I want to use it in snowpark sometimes).   
The best pair I tried was Dalbello krypton core 110, but after 30 mins of wearing them, I noticed that the zone above the heel started numbing.   
The second best was roxa element 120. I like all the properties of this pair except their stiffness (the weight is as low as a usual winter boot + excellent heel fixing).   
I also tested some other boots like dalbello ds 120 (which fits me but I want to have freeride/park boots with some amortization + cabrio design is much better at heel fixation + it's more expensive for some reason)   
So, my first question - what is a chance that krypton or element will fit me after I use them for a few days?   
Second question - should I try bootfitting them?  
The third one - maybe it's better to have a compromise in requirements and buy something without any discomfort?

1,lkxjbo,bbtheog51,"Hi everyone

So I'm an idiot and fucked up big time. I just bought new skis and bindings (Chamonix Bochard 92 and Atomic Z 10 bindings). When I received the Skis I noticed there were no recommended mounting lines :/ and the only shop around me wouldn't mount them. So I looked up on Youtube how to mount them and decided I would mount them true center. After mounting them I realized that was a very dumb move and should have done more research (lesson learned) and mounted them back further than the true center. Now my question is should I remount them? How much further back? I ride about 60% woods/groomed trails and 40% park. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am super bummed out about this.",Mounting bindings question,"hi everyone

1,lj8197,tpatter7,"Here's what the skis look like: https://imgur.com/a/oiW8yof

So here's the story. I recently went skiing for the first time in like 10+ years, and back then it was only a handful of times. So I'm pretty new to it. I had a friend who was helping me out, running down the slopes with me, showing me the ropes, etc. I caught on pretty quick, and after 3 or so hours the one thing I was having trouble with was taking slopes slowly/slowing down. After a couple of solid runs with no wipes, the night is nearly to an end. Maybe half an hour left before the lifts close down. So my buddy decides to split and go get in a few runs down some of the steeper slopes. By steeper, I'm pretty sure it was a blue slope, the hill we were on only had one spot that was barely considered black.

I, in my infinite wisdom, decide screw it imma follow him down. Yeah I realize I shouldn't have especially when having trouble slowing down. Well I make it to the bottom without a hitch, and it was fantastic. However, when I tried to slow down, I don't know if my skis caught something or what but I wiped. Hard. Still wish I had gotten it on camera. Slid 15-20 yards, but my skis stay on my feet, and I take a second to catch my breath. As I get up, my buddy pulls up next to me and points out my ski is at the wrong angle. Not my foot or anything , my ski. 

The skis were a little short for me, coming up to just under my collarbone, and it's what the lodge rental gave me, and obviously they're beginner rentals. The lodge took off the bindings and had me just pay for the skis themselves. I'm generally a pretty chill person so I went with it, but looking into it a bit more would love to get another opinion on the break.

While I walked away without a scratch, the ski broke towards the tip. What would have caused this? From what I understand this is incredibly uncommon, as breaks usually happen near the bindings. Manufacturing defect, improper maintenance, something else entirely? I ended up paying $90 USD, which I'm pretty sure is more then they were worth, and that was after discount from taking off the bindings.",Question about some broken skis,"here's what the skis look like: https://imgur.com/a/oiw8yof

1,liftis,dcg627,"I bought a pair of Lange SX 130 ski boots (they've renamed this model 'LX') a couple days ago.

They only had the 130 model in stock so I wasn't able to compare it to the 120 flex. The boot I am replacing has a flex of 110, and I'm worried that 130 will be too stiff for me. I was able to flex it ok in the store, but that's of course not the same as being out in the cold.

I'm pretty light, at around 158 lbs. I'd say I'm an advanced skier, but wouldn't call myself an expert.

Anyway, removing the bottom rivet on the back of the boot on the 130's brings the flex down to around a 115. I haven't been able to ski on it yet, but it made a noticeable difference just in my house.

The question I have is, which is the better route to take: Keep the 130s and reduce the flex by removing the rivet, or just get the 120's, and probably don't worry about removing a rivet?

I've heard that removing rivets will also reduce the amount of rebound of the boot.

The 130 model supposedly has a bit of a better liner than the 120, and also includes a spoiler (which I'd like, and the 120 does not have that).

I can get around alright, I can do blues and most single-blacks without much trouble, but I'm definitely not advanced.  

I've also been an avid lifter for the past 4 years, focusing on compound lifts (Deadlift, Squat, Bench).  I love doing it and it's a big focus of my life, and I'd say I'm relatively physically fit in general (I like to run for cardio).

I've had some issues with my lower back/hip area having pain due to heavy deadlifting/squatting (feels like it's somewhere around sciatic nerve).  It doesn't hurt doing everyday activities but I feel it flare up while doing cardio.  My lifting form is good now but in my first year or so I lifted with poor form which seems to have caused this lingering pain.  I  stretch around 3 times per week but I need to be doing it 1-2 times per day, I know.

Anyway, I went skiing this past weekend for the first time in two years with my friend.  I felt pretty good at first but then the pain started flaring up.  I'd feel it while I was making turns, this sharp pain that radiated in my lower back/hip flexor area on both sides.  By the end of both days I couldn't make it through a run without stopping multiple times.  I'm certain it stems from heavy deadlifting and maybe pushing myself too hard in the gym.

I'm nervous now because I'm supposed to go out west in March for a week with a few friends and I don't want to drag down the rest of them by not being able to ski due to pain.  I am wondering if I should go see a specialist about this because I want to get it sorted out as best as I can before the trip.  Would daily stretching be enough at this point?

1,l9y079,coconutbabe,"Beginner here. On my fourth class. 

1st class:  I can make basic turns and stops. 

2nd class: it was my first time went to the green and made some basic turns on the slope. The slope was steep (although it’s green) and I can really feel the pressure I have to use on my outside skis to be able to make turns. 

3rd class: I also practiced on the green, but with a very experienced coach. He really pushed me and made me to do all kinds of turns. It was also snowing really hard so the snow was super sticky. It felt like an intense workout. I am glad I skied in that condition and learnt from it. I also started to learn parallel, but using the lifting the inside ski approach. This is the class I felt that I advanced the most. 

4th class: continue practiced turns on the green with a different coach. The coach showed me the way to slide the inside skis rather than lift it to make the parallel. The coach said I was doing the parallel, and suggested me to use more practice to make my turns smoother and feel more confident and natural. I didn’t feel that I got much new info from the classes though. 

After a few hours practice after my last class, I feel pretty comfortable with the easy greens, turns, parallel, stops, picking up some speed when it’s not steep. I feel confident on easy greens and had some fun on some of the less groomed area on the side too. 

I think my challenges so far may include the fear of steep slope (even on green), I have the tendency to make turns to ski up the curve of the hill to avoid going down fast to lose control, speed control, make the turns more smooth, and keep the legs in complete parallel in between turns etc. I still don’t feel comfortable going to a more steep green or blue yet. But hope soon ! 

I would like to hear some advices on what I should work on on my own between my classes to progress, and how to set some goals for myself.

1,l9hwbi,im2lazy789,"Hi All,  


I've been an avid skier most of my life, though haven't done a ton of it the past couple years after my wife and I had a kid.  Now that she's almost five I'm trying to pass on snow sports to her so that we can have some fun in the winter.  I've always been pretty duck footed and have always suffered from some degree of either ankle pain or foot pain.  I invested in some new boots and skis last year and this year respectively.  I've gone through the practice of having the boots fitted to me to the extend of custom foot bed, hot molding the liner, getting the shell custom fitted as well.  I no longer have the ankle pain I used to suffer from, but it's been replaced by really awful foot pain - to the point that I couldn't even bear more than one run wincing the entire way down the hill, I was in pain even on the lift, and just scooting around at the base was rough too.  


The discomfort I'm experiencing is on my arches and on the bottom/outside of my foot from my heel to the top of my pinky toe and have some lingering numbness after skiing as well.  I've got the boots set pretty loose, just barely putting pressure on the buckles and it is still causing the pain. The reason I think it is related to my natural duck footed stance is that on a recent hike as I was walking back I noticed out toed out my foot prints were, when I decided to try and focus on point my toes straight as I walked I had similar pain.

i've been an avid skier most of my life, though haven't done a ton of it the past couple years after my wife and i had a kid.  now that she's almost five i'm trying to pass on snow sports to her so that we can have some fun in the winter.  i've always been pretty duck footed and have always suffered from some degree of either ankle pain or foot pain.  i invested in some new boots and skis last year and this year respectively.  i've gone through the practice of having the boots fitted to me to the extend of custom foot bed, hot molding the liner, getting the shell custom fitted as well.  i no longer have the ankle pain i used to suffer from, but it's been replaced by really awful foot pain - to the point that i couldn't even bear more than one run wincing the entire way down the hill, i was in pain even on the lift, and just scooting around at the base was rough too.  


the discomfort i'm experiencing is on my arches and on the bottom/outside of my foot from my heel to the top of my pinky toe and have some lingering numbness after skiing as well.  i've got the boots set pretty loose, just barely putting pressure on the buckles and it is still causing the pain. the reason i think it is related to my natural duck footed stance is that on a recent hike as i was walking back i noticed out toed out my foot prints were, when i decided to try and focus on point my toes straight as i walked i had similar pain.  it's as though this issue is muscle/nerve related not clamping pressure or hot points on the boot.

Atop

pine-crested

ridge, I stand beside

stained glass of Nature.

To my left, bygone footfalls

of wandering deer. To my right,

constellation of frozen droplets affixed

to branch and bough, adorning each with

straining, glist’ning beauty. Here I stand, boots

creaking, quads burning, mouth panting. There She

waits, brook burbling, snow shimmering, trees swaying.

Tense man. Tranquil environment. One perennial, the other

essential. Which am I? No matter. *I’m off* — Careening, gliding,

sliding. Violent activity amidst still environment. Air shrilling, ice

scraping, skis carving; cutting sinews of snow both hard and soft,

packed and powdered, icy and easy. Gravity my fuel, friction meager

myth. Down. Down. Down — Until I arrive at mechanical, manmade base.

Hey guys looking for some new stick suggestions for my fiancé! Looking to get her something in the mid 90 range for on pisté. Right now she has some Nordica that are 78 under foot and we’re good for learning but she’s looking to get something bigger under foot for when we get some snow and exploring trees a little bit 

Was looking at volkl secret 92’s and Salomon QST LUX 92’s but also wanted to see what else some of y’all suggest. Open to anything in the 90-96 range.

This is her 4th year skiing so she isn’t exactly schredding and hitting turns hard. So something a little more playful and easy to initiate turns would be great. Feel like she is really to advance a bit but not to advanced. She’s mostly a blue skier but exploring blacks 

Thanks y’all!",Women’s resort ski suggestions?!?,"

this is her 4th year skiing so she isn’t exactly schredding and hitting turns hard. so something a little more playful and easy to initiate turns would be great. feel like she is really to advance a bit but not to advanced. she’s mostly a blue skier but exploring blacks 

thanks y’all! women’s resort ski suggestions?!?",hey guy looking for some new stick suggestion for my fiancé looking to get her something in the mid range for on pisté right now she ha some nordica that are under foot and we re good for learning but she looking to get something bigger under foot for when we get some snow and exploring tree little bit wa looking at volkl secret and salomon qst lux but also wanted to see what else some of all suggest open to anything in the range this is her th year skiing so she isn exactly schredding and hitting turn hard so something little more playful and easy to initiate turn would be great feel like she is really to advance bit but not to advanced she mostly blue skier but exploring black thanks all woman resort ski suggestion

Yesterday I went skiing for the first time in 10 years - and it was nothing short of a disaster.

A year or so ago I impulsively purchased a new ski set, with boots, bindings, poles and skis. The skis are 170.

1,kutpok,Mucousmembrane95,"I am 25 years old and i’ve been skiing for about 3 years. I would consider myself beginner-intermediate . When I first started skiing I bought all my equipment used on craigslist, but this year I decided to get all new equipment. I was fitted for a pair of boots and the owner of the store who was helping me added a heel lift and a customized insole because my feet have a pretty high arch. The boots felt great at the store and I was very satisfied with the customer service.

After getting my new equipment, I spent a week at Big Snow in NJ (indoor ski “resort”). It’s just one slope, but I wanted to practice my parallel skiing. I had no problem with my boots and found them very comfortable.

This past weekend I visited Okemo with some friends. This was my first time skiing down a mountain this big. We took two lifts up the mountain and went to down upper mountain road (green circle) to lower mountain road (also green circle). By the time I got to lower mountain road I felt my foot moving around in my boot. I felt like I had no control of my skis because of how loose my boots were. My legs and hip started getting really sore and uncomfortable. My friends were pretty far ahead at this point and I just wanted to get down without hurting myself so I took my time.

When I finally made it down the mountain my ankles were killing me and I had to sit down. My friends (who all snowboard) suggested I tighten my boot buckles. The boot buckles were completely loose, but when I first put them on they were tight. I figured this was due to decompression of the liner. My friends were ready to go back up so I buckled my boots as tight as possible and hit the lift. I did a shorter trail just in case I ran into the same problem. 

The second run was much WORSE. My heels kept lifting and my foot was moving left and right inside the boot. I had to pull to the side and take my skis off to tighten my boots again. When I looked at my boot buckles the top two were loose again. I tightened them and tried to go down again and the same thing kept happening. There were some steep and narrow parts of the  trail (MOSTLY ICE). I was afraid of rolling my ankle so I took the skis off and walked down those parts. I was so frustrated, my feet were numb and I didn’t know what to do. It took me 1 hour to finally make it down the trail (mostly walking). I changed into my sneakers and called it a day. I contemplated selling my skis, but now that I have a clear head I want to solve this problem ASAP.

Planning on going back to the ski shop to make some adjustments to the boots. Is it normal for the boot buckles to get loose so frequently??! Is something wrong with my technique that would cause this to happen? Would loose boots cause a person to have no control of their turns/ snow plowing?

this past weekend i visited okemo with some friends. this was my first time skiing down a mountain this big. we took two lifts up the mountain and went to down upper mountain road (green circle) to lower mountain road (also green circle). by the time i got to lower mountain road i felt my foot moving around in my boot. i felt like i had no control of my skis because of how loose my boots were. my legs and hip started getting really sore and uncomfortable. my friends were pretty far ahead at this point and i just wanted to get down without hurting myself so i took my time.

when i finally made it down the mountain my ankles were killing me and i had to sit down. my friends (who all snowboard) suggested i tighten my boot buckles. the boot buckles were completely loose, but when i first put them on they were tight. i figured this was due to decompression of the liner. my friends were ready to go back up so i buckled my boots as tight as possible and hit the lift. i did a shorter trail just in case i ran into the same problem. 

the second run was much worse. my heels kept lifting and my foot was moving left and right inside the boot. i had to pull to the side and take my skis off to tighten my boots again. when i looked at my boot buckles the top two were loose again. i tightened them and tried to go down again and the same thing kept happening. there were some steep and narrow parts of the  trail (mostly ice). i was afraid of rolling my ankle so i took the skis off and walked down those parts. i was so frustrated, my feet were numb and i didn’t know what to do. it took me 1 hour to finally make it down the trail (mostly walking). i changed into my sneakers and called it a day. i contemplated selling my skis, but now that i have a clear head i want to solve this problem asap.

planning on going back to the ski shop to make some adjustments to the boots. is it normal for the boot buckles to get loose so frequently??! is something wrong with my technique that would cause this to happen? would loose boots cause a person to have no control of their turns/ snow plowing?

1,khsl81,Eryothus,"For the last two years I’ve been getting a lot of foot pain while skiing. I’m hoping someone here might be able to give me some advice on how to fix it. 

The pain starts within a few minutes of walking around in my boots, usually before I even get to lift or anything and continues until a couple hours after I ski. It’s always on the right food, at the lateral ankle, outer edge of the foot (around the proximal head of the 5th metatarsal) and the bottom of the foot near the origin of the plantar fascia. It’s intense-enough that I’m starting to avoid skiing (which isn’t like me at all). And it only happens in ski boots (backpacking, hiking, running, mountain biking, etc. don’t cause this sort of pain). 

I spoke with my doctor about it and he shrugged and told me it’s the ski boots and advised that I stop skiing. I’m currently waiting for an appointment with a Sports Med Doc hoping he’ll have better advice.

i usually get the all-mountain skis for groomers and i am pretty comfortable on blues with them.

one thing i have always wanted to do is learn to ski switch. everywhere i look people are saying i need twin tips to do so.

I'm getting some new Atomic Bent Chetler 100s(172cm) and I am at a bit of a roadblock however. I am looking at the Marker Squire 11 bindings but not sure which break width to choose. The widths that Squires come in are 90mm, 100mm, 110mm. Obviously the 90mm will not fit, however I am now stuck between the 100mm and 110mm. So my question is, for a ski with a waist width of 100mm, should I get a binding with a break width of 100mm or a binding with a break with of 110mm?

1,k189s3,djrolex,"I bought new skis and bindings online for the season last week and brought them into REI on Sunday to have the bindings mounted. Went to go pick them up today, and noticed that the bindings were mounted backwards...

They were very apologetic, and I didn't throw a fit, but I'm a bit bummed that my brand new pair of skis now are going to have to be re-drilled. They are going to try and remount the bindings on Saturday, and are going comp the service and give me a gift card. They mentioned that if the remount is impossible, then they could order me a new pair of skis. I have a feeling that this is something they won't end up offering though, and I'm worried about another subpar job.

My plan is to come in prepared on Saturday when I pick up the skis:

1. I'm going to ask for the minimum distance between new and old holes. If the distance they state is less than the manufactured recommended distance for remounting, then I'm going to ask for new skis.
2. If the mounting location is not specifically where I asked it to be, then I'm going to ask for a new pair of skis. I'm worried that they will flip the bindings around to my preferred location, realize that the new holes will be too close to the old ones, and move the mounting location to accommodate.

I got a pair of used skis from this old-moving job I had - the tenant had left them up for grabs so I claimed it. My knowledge on ski equipment is very limited so I would like some help on finding out more information on my skis and how to get boots that fit them.

The skis are Dynastar Speed Autodrive Carve and is an old model perhaps from the year 2001. This is the only hyperlink I can find out about it and was hoping you guys might know what these are [https://www.freeride.com/gear/skis/dynastar-speed-autodrive-carve.html](https://www.freeride.com/gear/skis/dynastar-speed-autodrive-carve.html).  


The bindings are ""look pivot 8.0- full drive technology"" and I don't know what that means or where to begin looking for boots. 

I would like to start skiing and would appreciate it if you guys can provide some advice on anything. It'll mean a lot if I could begin learning how to ski with these because the size is right for my height and weight apparently and I am short on cash right now - not too willing to spend a lot on equipment.

1,jriozc,HierophantsGhost,"Skiing is my boyfriends favorite hobby in the whole world. We met back in February before the pandemic started and he was constantly gone skiing at the time. He's been impatiently waiting all summer so he could go again and, this time, he wanted me to go with him. 
I knew about the little ski trip for a few weeks and spent a lot of time on the day before to prepare. I (26F) kept telling my SO (28M) that I wasn't looking forward to it because of my insane anxiety issues, but I'd go to try it with him. He told me that if I perceive it as a negative thing, then it'll be a negative day. I tried it keep it together as we prepared, the anxiety buzzing at the back of my mind the whole time. I slept pretty well the night before and was ready to go when it was time.
Then it became a nightmare from there. He let me drive the hour and forty minutes to the resort and I have 2 panic attacks. One of them was when we went through a very long tunnel and I started getting super claustrophobic. I could barely contain the screaming as I drove down it. 

I pulled over and let my SO drive the last 20 minutes as I broke down in another panic attack and cried until I was red in the face. When we got to the resort, my stomach was upset and I needed to use the bathroom. When he told me we would have to walk pretty far in ski boots just to get to the bathroom, I started crying again. I dont know if you guys know about rental ski boots - but they are PAINFUL. for some reason, they wouldn't fit around my calves right and were crushing them. 

Once we forced them on, I limped my way through the parking lot to get to the bathrooms. I was feeling a little better after but I still felt very nauseous. As we were waiting in line for our ski passes, my anxiety was in overdrive. My thoughts were racing so fast about all the things that could go wrong today. All I wanted to do was either sit down or go back to the car. When we got in line for the gondolas, I almost started to cry again. I asked my SO if I could just go back to the car because I was really struggling and I didn't want to do this anymore. He wouldn't let me back out. I managed to somehow keep my heart from thudding out of my chest as we rode the gondola to the top of the mountain. When we got to the top, he wanted to take pictures in front of some really pretty scenery. I thought ""cool we got some pictures, can I please go home now?"".
Nope. What would follow was a very long (3.5 mile) downhill slope that I would fall down on more than 50 times. Because my SO took the ""oh you can't swim? Let me throw you in a lake and you'll learn real fast"" approach. My stomach hurt the entire time. I tired eating a single reeses and almost puked so I had to spit it out on the side of the mountain. 

Eventually I got a little better at turning. After having fallen about 30 times and the brushes starting to stack, I wanted to get it right so I could go home. Thats all I could think about: ""I want to get off this Goddamn mountain and go home"". 

When we were about 2/3 of the way down, I got a little too ambitious about getting this process over with and started hauling ass down the mountain. I went to turn to the left to try to slow down and ate shit so hard both my skis flew off. I felt my left leg twist in a way it probably shouldn't have and something in my knee popped. When my SO came to retrieve me, I rubbed it off and we kept going. I did not want to stop for any reason. He helped me get down a lot of the mountain and the people who worked there were genuinely concerned about me being out there - as they were right to. One guy at the beginning suggested we go to the beginner side and my SO basically shooed him away. Another guy was trying to tell him to take a different route so I wouldn't get hurt and he got shooed as well. 

Then just a few hundred feet after id twisted my knee, some snowboarding jackass that was going way too fast colided with me. He hit me right in the same leg I had just twisted. He was told to slow down and went on his way. Thankfully he'd hit me in the boot so nothing got broken. If he'd hit me in the knee I'd just twisted, I'm sure it would have broken and I would have had a very bad few months to follow. We finally got to the bottom of the mountain and I was limping so bad I could barley walk. My SO grabbed my skiis from me and headed to the parking lot while I very slowly made my way through the resort village to follow him. 
When we got in the car, my shirt and pants were soaked, my entire left leg was in throbbed pain, I could barely sit from the brushes on my hips from falling all day and my stomach still hurt. We got about 20 minutes away from the resort when we encountered a crash on the very narrow, cliffside road. We had to sit and wait for an hour while people tried to unfuck themselves from the jam they kept adding to. Being in the car is very, very hard for me because of my claustrophobia and that accident added way too much time to an already long ass drive home. I tried everything I could to stay calm from breathing, to self talk, to positive thinking, to zoning out, etc. I very narrowly avoided my 3rd panic attack of the day. Eventually I had to take my thermal pants off in the car because they were so soaked from the snow, it was making my butt feel frozen. So I rode home in the car in my underwear. 

I checked myself for bruises when I got home- they are everywhere. Huge ones on both my thighs where I kept landing when I fell, some deep red ones on my elbows, and both my shins from the boots. My left hand hurt from catching my falls too many times and my left knee would scream everytime I put pressure on it. 
As I lay here now, I'm trying to keep it elevated. I'm going to a doctor this week hopefully to make sure I didnt tear something serious. My entire body hurts and flipping over in bed is an excruciating process. 

Needless to say, I let my SO know I will never be going skiing again.",I went skiing for the first time today and it couldn't have gone worse,"skiing is my boyfriends favorite hobby in the whole world. we met back in february before the pandemic started and he was constantly gone skiing at the time. he's been impatiently waiting all summer so he could go again and, this time, he wanted me to go with him. 
i knew about the little ski trip for a few weeks and spent a lot of time on the day before to prepare. i (26f) kept telling my so (28m) that i wasn't looking forward to it because of my insane anxiety issues, but i'd go to try it with him. he told me that if i perceive it as a negative thing, then it'll be a negative day. i tried it keep it together as we prepared, the anxiety buzzing at the back of my mind the whole time. i slept pretty well the night before and was ready to go when it was time.
then it became a nightmare from there. he let me drive the hour and forty minutes to the resort and i have 2 panic attacks. one of them was when we went through a very long tunnel and i started getting super claustrophobic. i could barely contain the screaming as i drove down it. 

i pulled over and let my so drive the last 20 minutes as i broke down in another panic attack and cried until i was red in the face. when we got to the resort, my stomach was upset and i needed to use the bathroom. when he told me we would have to walk pretty far in ski boots just to get to the bathroom, i started crying again. i dont know if you guys know about rental ski boots - but they are painful. for some reason, they wouldn't fit around my calves right and were crushing them. 

once we forced them on, i limped my way through the parking lot to get to the bathrooms. i was feeling a little better after but i still felt very nauseous. as we were waiting in line for our ski passes, my anxiety was in overdrive. my thoughts were racing so fast about all the things that could go wrong today. all i wanted to do was either sit down or go back to the car. when we got in line for the gondolas, i almost started to cry again. i asked my so if i could just go back to the car because i was really struggling and i didn't want to do this anymore. he wouldn't let me back out. i managed to somehow keep my heart from thudding out of my chest as we rode the gondola to the top of the mountain. when we got to the top, he wanted to take pictures in front of some really pretty scenery. i thought ""cool we got some pictures, can i please go home now?"".
nope. what would follow was a very long (3.5 mile) downhill slope that i would fall down on more than 50 times. because my so took the ""oh you can't swim? let me throw you in a lake and you'll learn real fast"" approach. my stomach hurt the entire time. i tired eating a single reeses and almost puked so i had to spit it out on the side of the mountain. 

eventually i got a little better at turning. after having fallen about 30 times and the brushes starting to stack, i wanted to get it right so i could go home. thats all i could think about: ""i want to get off this goddamn mountain and go home"". 

when we were about 2/3 of the way down, i got a little too ambitious about getting this process over with and started hauling ass down the mountain. i went to turn to the left to try to slow down and ate shit so hard both my skis flew off. i felt my left leg twist in a way it probably shouldn't have and something in my knee popped. when my so came to retrieve me, i rubbed it off and we kept going. i did not want to stop for any reason. he helped me get down a lot of the mountain and the people who worked there were genuinely concerned about me being out there - as they were right to. one guy at the beginning suggested we go to the beginner side and my so basically shooed him away. another guy was trying to tell him to take a different route so i wouldn't get hurt and he got shooed as well.

1,jqhgnl,dishonoredcorvo69,"Hello, I am trying to plan a ski trip to Keystone, Colorado. I have never been skiing and I have no idea what I’m doing! The dates I’m looking at are Jan 2nd- Jan 8th. Apologies in advance if my formatting is bad, I’m using the mobile app. 

I was advised to stay at a ski-in ski-out resort; however, I haven’t bought an epic pass yet as I am not sure if I should get a 4 day pass or the Keystone plus pass that would allow a 7-day ski trip. Since I don’t have the pass, I can’t see the reservation options through the epic website. However, I have looked at some airbnbs and another website called summit. Would you recommend I stick with the epic reservations, or book outside the website? 

Equipment rental is very confusing too. Someone had suggested I pick up the ski equipment in Denver and then go down to the ski resort, and find a company that also works at the resort so I can exchange it for free if necessary. However, I can’t seem to find a place that does that in Keystone? If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

What is the best way to go about car rentals? I have been to Denver airport twice and both times I have had an unpleasant experience with the process there, not sure what I’m doing wrong here.

Any advice on booking lessons would also be appreciated, as well as other suggestions/advice on how to make this trip work out best!","Total noob here trying to plan a ski trip to Keystone, CO - any advice is appreciated!","hello, i am trying to plan a ski trip to keystone, colorado. i have never been skiing and i have no idea what i’m doing! the dates i’m looking at are jan 2nd- jan 8th. apologies in advance if my formatting is bad, i’m using the mobile app.

Since my partner got skis this season and I'm planning to ski a lot more this season too, I think it's time for me to invest into tools for proper ski waxing. I used to bring my skis to the shop every 2 months or so, but it might be a better idea financially to do it myself.

I would love to hear any advice on what tools and wax to get. I already watched a few videos on how to wax skis, but I'm still curious to get more material to read/watch if you have some.

The skis that I will have to wax:

* Blizzard Rustler 9
* Blizzard Rustler 10
* Blizzard Cochise

I'd been away from skiing for about 10 years up until last season when I bought some heavily-used skis for $50 and did a couple trips to VT, NY and PA. I'm looking to buy some new skis this year and can't decide whether to go with a length of 167cm or 172cm. My old skis were 165cm, and I'm 5'10"" and 155lb. I skied \~90% on piste and was comfortable on double blacks but I still would consider myself closer to intermediate than advanced. I feel like maybe 5cm won't make too much of a difference and 172cm should be fine as that is what I see recommended for someone of my height and weight.

I’m relatively new to skiing. I decided to buy boots. I’m a 21 year-old man, 5’9 (1m74),152 lbs (69kg). My feet are 96mm wide, and my feet are 255. I initially bought boots (Dalbello DS 90), which cost me CAD$400. The price seemed pretty steep for me, but there aren’t many boots that are my size. I went to a tore today, where I ended up buying Lange RS 70 short cuff, which are a kids’ model. The initial price was $380, but were on sale so I got them at $228, which is definitely better for my budget.

But heres the thing I don't jump or race anymore, the most aggressive thing I do is higher speed mid radius turns. Anything black diamond I'm not skiing aggressively just having fun.  And ski tech has changed dramatically since my original richle boots.

Long story short, a colleague moved away and had to get rid of a load of his stuff. He kindly gave me his skis (used once but look like new) as we used to talk about ski trips. 

On reflection I don’t think owning skis is suited for me (I go so infrequently I don’t mind renting). 

I was wondering if you could give some advice on what a fair value for the skis would be?

1,i5izlh,BindingBot,"I’m a ski tech / bike mechanic, and while stuck at home (high risk for Covid-19) I’ve come up with a few tool ideas for ski mounting. I’m just starting to collect some data so I know if there’s any demand for these improvements, and whether other shops have the same issues as the shops I’ve worked in. I would appreciate any input from other techs as well as any skiers who have had issues with mounts in the past.

The common errors I see are mis-drills due to wrong jig/pattern, or grabbing parts from two different work orders by accident; jig moved while drilling; jig feet not even, so holes off centre; dimpled ski due to hole too shallow / screw too long.

What is the most common cause of errors in your shop? Which of the common errors do you most want a solution for? And what’s your shop’s overall error rate? From what I’ve seen and heard from other shops something like 1% of mounts end up screwed up - how does that track with your experiences?

**Scars (of any size or location) or limb loss from a skiing or snowsports injury?**

**Take part in an online questionnaire and help develop psychological support for those who need it**

**You can also enter a prize draw for up to £100 in Amazon vouchers**

**To take part:** [**go.uwe.ac.uk/unitscivilian**](https://go.uwe.ac.uk/unitscivilian)

**\*\*\***

We are researchers from the Centre for Appearance Research at the University of the West of England, Bristol, UK, and we would like to invite you to take part in our study.

We want to understand the similarities and differences between UK military veterans and non-veterans who have had injuries that changed their appearance e.g. scars of any size or location, or limb loss. Existing psychological support has been designed for people with injuries not related to military conflict. Through our research, we want to understand if current support would be useful for military veterans, or if being injured during military conflict means they need different kinds of support. We will also get a better understanding of the experiences of non-veterans with scars and limb loss which could inform appearance-related support for everyone.

We are inviting:

\- **People who have never served in the Armed Forces but have scars (of any size or location) or limb loss due to an unexpected injury/accident\***…to complete a questionnaire here: [go.uwe.ac.uk/unitscivilian](https://go.uwe.ac.uk/unitscivilian)

***\* Injuries should have been sustained at least 1 year ago and when over the age of 18 years***

AND

\- **Veterans who served in the British military since 1969, and have scars (anywhere on the face or body) or limb loss because of a deployment or deployment training injury**…to complete a questionnaire here: [go.uwe.ac.uk/unitsveteran](https://go.uwe.ac.uk/unitsveteran)

It should take about 30 minutes to fill out. To thank you for taking part, you can be entered into a prize draw. There are over ten chances of winning between £25 and £100 in Amazon vouchers or a donation to a charity of your choice.

You can request a paper copy, with return stamped envelope, by contacting the research team at [unitsstudy@uwe.ac.uk](mailto:unitsstudy@uwe.ac.uk).

Taking part is voluntary and your responses confidential.

My Aunt is a ~Saint~ in her 60s and loves all things pow, and currently spends her winters teaching Boston’s inner city to ski in the mountains of NH. (She even got me into it it’s great). 

She spent her younger years in Colorado and the northeast and loves a ski vacation. she’s been skiing in Switzerland so she’s not afraid to leave the US. Her favorite mountain is Alta. She’s glad she started teaching because it’s saved her from injury unlike her friends!

1,gjpwy9,waffle1178,"So I started skiing a little over a year ago and I'm ready to ditch my rentals for some gear of my own. I recently got a pair of K2 empress 2020, 139 ski's (111,86,106).

Now I'm looking for a decent pair of boots that fit good for short people/legs/calves. (Especially now with a lot of sales going on) I do plan to go to a proper boot fitter once everything opens again, but would love some recommendations to start with when I'm there. And research in the meantime.

My first rental for boots was very high on my calf which caused excruciating leg pains a few hours into a green trail ski day. I went back and switched them out for the ones I was using all of last snow year. I believe they were Solomon 550 divine. And the boot says 23,5/278.

They fit good but towards the end of the season as I improved I feel they were a bit loose. I had trouble getting good stability in the front of my foot, and my heal wasnt staying in place in the back of the boot.

I would prefer a boot with walk mode. I've looked at Dahu and apex boots online and I like the idea of new tech design rather than the standard style, but I've only seen them online. If you have any input on these boots for short women I'd appreciate it. If it's worth it I wouldn't mind spending 5-600$.

So, any good short cuff boot suggestions for a 4""10."" female of 115 lbs? Typically I wear a size 6-6.5 street shoe.

1,gg5t3k,Apple_Pi,"I consider the Epic Tahoe Ski Pass a pretty good deal. For ~$600 I could ski unlimited at Kirkwood, Heavenly, and Northstar, plus limited trips to Park City, Vail, Breckenridge and others. Pretty good deal until you consider we were planning trips in late March and early April. Of course, that meant we paid $600 for nothing since COVID-19 forced the shutdown of all of the resorts. I am not complaining about that. That was the right call for everyone's safety. I am complaining about the company not considering a refund for those of us who were not able to use or had limited use of our passes. The airline returned my cost of the plane tickets. The condo returned my rental fee and deposit.


I did reach out to Epic many weeks ago and was told they were thinking about it. Well, they have finished thinking about it and are not considering a refund. Instead they are offering me an 80% discount on next year's pass. While that may sound reasonable on the surface, I would say not. That just means they get to keep all of my money even though they were not able to provide the product that I paid for. Instead, they will let me send them additional money for something that I may not be able to use.


I am pretty upset about this, but wanted to hear what other skiers think. What say all of you?

Hi everyone, my name is Daniel, and I'm a co-host for the Passion Fruits Podcast. Each episode we discuss subjects that we are passionate about, and try to examine how someone goes from a casual fan to a fanatic. We've had episodes ranging from Metallica to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Mountain Biking to Frasier. For one of our recent episodes, we discussed my co-host, Adam's, passion for skiing. He has made 2 trips to Canada this past season, and has become an avid skier. I, on the other hand, haven't skied since high school, so it was fun to talk to him about his passion, the ski industry, and its environmental impact.

I'll admit, we can be a little irreverent and silly sometimes, but we had a lot of fun recording this episode, and it made me want to try my hand at skiing again.

1,fk116j,mtnrunner0,"I bought new skis on a ski trip a couple months ago and recently found 1 screw backed out. I was able to get a replacement screw but the screw doesn't quite catch.

The same screw on the other ski also came out really easily when I checked. It seems like the hole that was drilled is slightly too big. I wish I could go back to the ski shop where I got the skis, but it's not an option (too far away).

The loose screw is by the toe piece on the Shift touring binding and my skis have a wood core.

Has anyone successfully used matches/toothpicks as a filler (along with wood glue) to get a tight and secure fit? I'm currently trying with matches (all I had around) and it seems to hold better than before, but the wood from the matches might be a bit too soft. Perhaps a bit harder wood from a toothpick would work better?

I've also read about using steel wool and epoxy but I'm not sure if that's necessary for this, unless the above doesn't work out. 

A last resort would be heli coils I suppose.

Dear, r/ski

I am an avid skier and I would consider myself an expert skier, I grew up in Vancouver skiing Whistler, Revelstoke, Big Sky, Grouse, Mt. Rainer, road trips to Tahoe in California, and also Park City a few teams as well as Colorado a few times(Copper, Vail, A-Basin). I plan on taking a friend of mine who is also an expert skier as well as my girlfriend(she has skied twice and is intermediate and I plan on teaching her a bit on the trip). Anyways, I am in Florida for College now and plan on doing this Vermont trip the first week of January next season, like January 6-10 2021. I just have a few questions.

1. What is the best resort as far as cliff lines, glades, expert runs, etc.?
2. What is the cheapest resort as far as tickets and lodging?
3. Is it easier to stay at the mountain or just stay in Burlington and uber to the slopes?
4. Best resort for terrain parks?
5. Best resort with good food and a nice culture/vibe?

Sorry for the long post and thanks for the help",Vermont 2021,"

i am an avid skier and i would consider myself an expert skier, i grew up in vancouver skiing whistler, revelstoke, big sky, grouse, mt. rainer, road trips to tahoe in california, and also park city a few teams as well as colorado a few times(copper, vail, a-basin). i plan on taking a friend of mine who is also an expert skier as well as my girlfriend(she has skied twice and is intermediate and i plan on teaching her a bit on the trip). anyways, i am in florida for college now and plan on doing this vermont trip the first week of january next season, like january 6-10 2021. i just have a few questions.

1. what is the best resort as far as cliff lines, glades, expert runs, etc.?
2. what is the cheapest resort as far as tickets and lodging?
3. is it easier to stay at the mountain or just stay in burlington and uber to the slopes?
4. best resort for terrain parks?
5. best resort with good food and a nice culture/vibe?

1,fiwppu,workitloud,"Update on Vail Resorts Operations from CEO Rob Katz
RESORTS WILL NOT OPERATE SUNDAY, MARCH 15 THROUGH SUNDAY, MARCH 22, WITH FURTHER GUIDANCE TO FOLLOW

This has no doubt been an incredibly challenging time. With 37 resorts spread across 15 states and three countries, we – like the rest of the world – have been closely tracking every new development related to coronavirus (COVID-19) and have been in constant contact with local health officials for guidance. Without question, our top priority has been the health and wellbeing of our guests and employees – and to no lesser extent the health and wellbeing of the communities where we operate. We know each decision we make has a broad impact far beyond our operations.

With each of those stakeholders in mind and with the most updated information from local health officials, we have made the difficult decision to suspend the operations of all our North American mountain resorts and retail stores beginning Sunday, March 15, 2020 through Sunday, March 22, 2020 and will use that time to reassess our approach for the rest of the season. Our lodging and property management operations will remain open to service the guests we have on location or those with existing reservations, but we will not be taking new reservations for this upcoming week. Epic Mountain Express, our Colorado shuttle service, will also continue operations to support the travel needs of our guests. We will be closing our corporate offices and apart from essential personnel, we will be asking other employees to work from home, where possible.

All our scheduled employees, both seasonal and year-round, will be paid during this upcoming eight-day period, without needing to use any vacation or sick time. Their commitment to our company and guests during this uncertain time has been unwavering and I am personally grateful beyond words.

This decision provides a pause for the entire ecosystem of our mountain resort communities. It gives everyone the time to assess the situation, respond to ever-changing developments, and evaluate the approach for the rest of season, if we believe it is advisable or feasible to re-open. This was not an easy decision to make, as we deeply considered the impact it will have on our guests, employees, and the people and businesses in our communities. We understand this change may be confusing given our communications of operational changes over the past week, and as late as last night. Please know that this has been a fast-moving, constantly developing situation with new information from our communities coming to us by the day, if not by the hour, and we are trying to react as quickly as we can. People may also wonder why we are not giving more notice ahead of this closure. We understand the challenges this creates, but our priority is to minimize any additional issues from operating in further uncertainty and to avoid potential crowding.

We sincerely apologize to guests who are currently at our resorts – and those who were planning to come during this time. We have information on cancellations, refunds and travel credits on our websites. Many things like ski school, lift tickets, equipment rentals, and transportation can be fully refunded, and we have new credit policies in place for our owned and operated lodging properties. Please know that we will get to everyone and appreciate your patience as our most immediate priority must be the health and welfare of our resorts and communities. I know there are a lot of questions about our season pass products and Epic Day Passes. Those products are non-refundable and not transferable to another season, however, we will be reviewing those policies and providing any updated guidance on that in the coming weeks. Again, we very much appreciate your patience with this as well.

We will be providing updated information on the remainder of the season by Friday, March 20, 2020.

These are unprecedented, challenging times for everyone. We will continue to navigate these unchartered waters with our guests, our employees and our communities remaining our highest priority. I am certain that there have been, and will be, moments where we will miss the mark and potentially disappoint. However, rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback – and continue to make the best decisions we can for everyone’s wellbeing.

A little about myself: I am a registered nurse (24) from Belgium with 2 bachelors. One in nursing &amp; one in emergency healthcare. 

  
I was looking into working a season abroad in a ski resort and I was wondering if any of you had any experience with this. 

Are there certain travel organisations you get to work for and find a place of work by these means (by travelling along with them) or should I approach hospitals directly with an application or are there sites that are specified to this?

&amp;#x200B;

I found out the [www.viamonde.com](https://www.viamonde.com) takes on healthcare councellors but I couldn't find any other organisations that work like this. Any recommendations or tips would be helpful!

a little about myself: i am a registered nurse (24) from belgium with 2 bachelors. one in nursing &amp; one in emergency healthcare. 

  
i was looking into working a season abroad in a ski resort and i was wondering if any of you had any experience with this. 

are there certain travel organisations you get to work for and find a place of work by these means (by travelling along with them) or should i approach hospitals directly with an application or are there sites that are specified to this?

&amp;#x200b;

i found out the [www.viamonde.com](https://www.viamonde.com) takes on healthcare councellors but i couldn't find any other organisations that work like this. any recommendations or tips would be helpful!

1,ey5cm2,smashingwatermelon,"Hi guys,

Finally decided to commit to a new pair of skis. Have been thinking Rossignol experience 84 as I have skied on multiple occasions. I'm 178cm,  weight only 65kg, more of an intermediate skier (depends on how you defines it...) and mainly ski in Australia, so mostly on front side, firm to slightly soft snow. The shop that I rent from only have 163cm and that's what I've been ski on, very versatile, fun at short crave turns but does not go very fast and chatter at high speed. Perhaps it's too short? The guy at the shop suggested that the length appropriate for me given my weight. I'm a decent ice skater and thus very comfortable putting weight on edges despite being ""intermediate"" skier.

The other one that I've tried recently was Dynastar Speedzone 4x4 82 at 171cm, I found that very stable at wider turns and at speed, kind of like that feeling, but I cannot do short turns on this thing gracefully. I'm guessing I cannot put enough force on the edge unless I'm going fast. Either my skills (more likely), or my weight that I cannot push down on a longer/stiffer ski at slow speed?

I'm looking for skis that able to help me grow in terms of skills, able to do short-medium crave turns and stable when I want to go fast. Would appreciate your opinion and experience!

&amp;#x200B;

Rossignol Experience 84, 168cm
